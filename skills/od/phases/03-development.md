## 1. Execution Protocol

1. **Safety checkpoint**: Only if `auto_checkpoint: true` → `git stash`. Never auto-commit.
2. **Pre-Dev Scope** (B.15): Required per complexity. Keep output ≤25 lines for M.
3. **Load design**: `grep '## Feature {FN}' 04-design.md` → read only that section (≈20-40 lines). When `design_split: true`: read `features/FN.md` instead.
4. **Execute groups** from `02-plan.md`. Sub-agents per config (§1.2).
5. **After each task**: `[x]` in plan; archive progress; **unload** that feature's design section from context.
6. **git diff**: Always `--stat` first. Full diff only for active fix (±30 lines).
7. **Task-level recovery record** (new): after every task, append to `03-progress.md`:
   ```
   ✅ T3 · [files modified, comma-separated] · [time]
   ```
   When `/od x` interrupts mid-task (`[-]`): record `[-] T3 · files: [comma-separated] · [time]` so `/od re` knows what was touched.
8. **Change Impact** (B.15): Per complexity tier.
9. **Security Audit (B.22)** — mandatory before phase-end Handoff when `security_audit: true` (§5).
10. Log token estimate + `metrics.json` on phase exit.

## 1.1 Confirmation Levels (B.15) — Interactive Gates

All complexity levels **must** show `checkpoint` (B.8) popup at **phase end** (after security PASS/WAIVED). Intermediate gates:

| Complexity | Pre-Dev (`pre_dev`) | Per-Group Impact (`change_impact`) | Phase End |
|------------|---------------------|--------------------------------------|-----------|
| S | Only when departing from plan / user requests | Only when departing | **Required** `checkpoint` |
| M | **Required** once (interactive) | **Required** when departing | **Required** |
| L/XL | **Required** | **Required** every group | **Required** |

Invoke: [interactive-prompt.md](../engine/interactive-prompt.md) §3.12 → §4/§5/§6/§7 → **STOP — WAIT**.
If native UI missing: copy §8 **Markdown table** (`/od y` · `/od ad` · `/od x`). **Forbidden**: prose-only menus, box-drawing, `||` frames, pad-aligned fake modals.

---

## 1.2 Sub-Agent Dispatch (`sub_agents`)

| Mode | Phase 3 |
|------|---------|
| **off** | Main agent serial — default for S/M |
| **auto** | Workers only if L/XL AND ≥3 independent tasks in group |
| **on** | 1 worker per independent task |

Workers: same branch, disjoint files, ≤30 line report. Pre-Dev + Change Impact: main agent only.

---

## 2. Impact Analysis

### 2.1 Pre-Development Scope — compact table format, max 15 file rows

### 2.2 Change Impact — use `git diff --stat`; max 15 file rows; prose ≤10 lines

---

## 3. DevSecOps (light, per task)

Before marking a task `[x]`, quick scan touched files for obvious S1–S4 issues (secrets, injection, missing authz, dangerous APIs). Fix in-task when cheap. Full gate is §5.

Stability level in `00-project-context.md` may raise expectations (e.g. regulated → stricter).

---

## 5. Security Audit Gate (B.22) — before Handoff / Phase 4

**MUST** execute [security-audit.md](../engine/security-audit.md) when `config.security_audit` is not `false`:

1. Audit AI-touched scope → write `07-security-audit.md`.
2. **PASS** → Phase Handoff Block → B.8 `checkpoint` (next usually Phase 4 Test).
3. **FAIL** → findings summary → iterate loop:
   - **Non-autopilot**: `security_iterate_confirm` → **STOP — WAIT** → only after user confirms `iterate` apply fixes → re-audit.
   - **Autopilot**: auto-pick `iterate` (no STOP) → fix → re-audit until PASS or max iterations → then hard `b0_confirm` if still FAIL.
4. **WAIVED** (after B.0) → may advance like PASS; record reasons in report.
5. Do **not** present phase-end `checkpoint` / board-next to Phase 4 while status is FAIL and `security_audit_blocking: true`.

Chat: ≤12-line audit summary + path to `07-security-audit.md`. No full SAST log paste.

---

## 4. Greenfield vs Legacy & Unit Tests

| Type | Rule |
|------|------|
| **legacy** | Match existing test patterns; extend `*_test.go` / `*.test.ts` |
| **greenfield** | Scaffold tests per `05-test-plan.md`; Playwright if E2E required |

### 4.1 Unit Tests — MANDATORY During Phase 3

Every logic/backend/utility task **must** ship with **UNIT** tests before task `[x]`:

1. Map task → `05-test-plan.md` TC-F*-U* IDs
2. Create or update test file in same task group
3. Run quick UNIT for touched files (`npm test -- --findRelatedTests` / `go test ./pkg/...`)
4. Append to `03-progress.md`: `unit_tests: [TC-F1-U01, TC-F1-U02]`

Phase 4 UNIT gate expects these to exist — missing → Phase 4 Gap Backfill (test-strategy §5).

Frontend component tasks: UNIT via testing-library / vitest per repo convention.
